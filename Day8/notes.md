8. Hoisting:

Accessing the global scope without declaring it
to overcome this issues they introduced scope
and scope means accessibility

3. Template literals:

It is used to avoid the multiple lines of concatination
it is very hard to read so Es6 intro the new feature its
very easy to concatinate

4. Spread operator:

syntax:
...

It is used in many ways like expanding cards, converting string into char array
combining the arrays, key value pairs

Rest operators:

It is also same as spread operators the only differece is it is used inside the
functions and it can be used inside any type of functions

5. Destructuring:

It is used to unpack the array elements
if you want to store both the names in different variables without using
spread operator means we can use this method and it is especially used in
react js and node js
