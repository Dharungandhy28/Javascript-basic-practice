1. Objects
2. For in loop
3. Array of objects
4. Json

5. Objects:

i) An object is a key value pair of structure
and it is easy for representation and accessibility
ii) object is a userdefined data types

syntax:
var objectname = {key:value};

iii) Accessing the values inside the objects
Two methods:

- Dot operator -> dot method
- Box method

2.  For in loop:

i) For in loop is the alternative of for loop
ii) It is applicable only for objects
iii) For in loop is single direction where as for loop is multi direction

syntax:
for(var key in obj){
code
}

3. Array of objects:

i) objects inside the array is called as array of objects
ii) we can use both dot and box method here
iii) To print all the data one by one we can use for loop

syntax:
var arr = [{write code here},{write code here}];

4. Json:

i) Json -> Javascript object notation
ii) It looks like an objects but not an objects
iii) Accessing methods are same as we use in objects

syntax:
var arr ={
code
}
