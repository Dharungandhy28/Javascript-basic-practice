### Day 7

\*\* Functions
i) Function is a group of statements and it is reusability
ii) We ccan declare it once and we can use it multiple times
iii) It makes the program easier as easy small task is divided
into as function and it increases the readability:

There are four types of functions:

1 -> Named or Normal Function
2 -> Anonymous Function
3 -> IFFE Function
4 -> Arrow Function

1.  -> Named or Normal Function
    syntax:
    function function name(){return}

here function name should be unique and
it is userdefined.

2.  -> Anonymous Function
    syntax:
    variable variable name = function(){return}

we cannot call this function directly we have
to use parameters to call this function.

3.  -> IFFE Function
    syntax:
    (function(){no return})

We can use it in rare place it consume less memory function
name is optional to call this function we have to use ();

4.  -> Arrow Function
    syntax:
    variable variable name = () => {};

It is very popular and we can use it in react node etc...
If we want we can use return statement or else no need
it is code redundancy.

questions:
1-> print three multiplication using Named,Anonymous,IFFE,Arrow functions
2-> Find the average of the mark of 5 students you can use the array of the
arguments:
